The first season of this series explored the unforgettable life of Princess Diana. On season two, just like a treasured mixtape from your favorite crush, the series is a reflection of all the care and passion, the big moments and small, that made up a life. Prince's life.",

It was the sleaze and debauchery, the raunch and roll. Riki Rachtman former host of MTV's Headbangers Ball owned the Cathouse. He opened it with his roommate Taime Downe from the band Faster Pussycat with the premise of getting free drinks and meeting girls.\n\n    Riki enforced a no camera rule at the Cathouse so anything could and did happen. These stories have never been told......Until now\n\nEach episode of Cathouse Hollywood Riki recaps 1 night at the Cathouse and he recounts the night with a participant or witness to what took place that evening. His guest could be a a musician that sold 5 million records or the girl that worked the coat check. It doesn't matter at Riki Rachtman's World Famous Cathouse we were all Rock Stars",

						'California Love is a blend of memoir, pop culture analysis and oral history. The newest season, K-pop Dreaming, is about the rise and history of K-pop in the United States, as told from the point-of-view of the Korean diaspora in Los Angeles. Host Vivian Yoon takes listeners on a journey from K-pop’s origins in Korean trot music and American presence in post-war South Korea to the 1992 LA Uprising and the booming global popularity of K-pop in the present day, all juxtaposed against Yoon’s own coming-of-age as a second generation immigrant in Los Angeles, struggling to fit in and come to terms with her own identity. The series premieres on February 23rd.\n\nIn the first season Walter Thompson-Hernández was inspired by Tupac and Dr. Dre\'s "California Love"- a love letter and anthem for a generation. Walter invites listeners to join him in his family home, on horseback through the streets of Compton, and up into the sky to examine belonging.',

Hosted by Apple Music's Ebro Darden, The Message is a series that aims to further the dialogue about the unrest and inequalities in the United States and abroad via intimate conversations with some of the most prominent voices in the culture today, who also create exclusive playlists of the songs inspiring them to keep pushing forward.\nGuests include Jon Batiste, Erykah Badu, Jon Stewart, Nikole Hannah-Jones, Common, Vince Staples, and many more. Follow to get the uncut and uncensored interviews delivered to you every two weeks, and subscribe to Apple Music to listen to the guests' playlists and add them to your library.",

						"“Every Voice with Terrance McKnight” is a show that spotlights the vibrant stories and perspectives that reflect the whole of the American musical experience. \n\nThere are many different kinds of classical music, depending on where you are in the world. While this music typically preserves the traditions of a given society, classical music in America remains wedded to its Western European roots. On this show, we want to know why — and what America’s classical music really sounds like. Through interviews, historical investigation, and personal storytelling, Terrance McKnight unearths the hidden voices that have been shaping our musical traditions all along. \n\nOur debut season examines the representation of Blackness in opera. While character flaws are universal, stereotypes often fall along racial lines. We look at the loneliness, jealousy, self-loathing, and cultural appropriation associated with African characters in 18th and 19th century operas by Mozart and Verdi, and we introduce the African-American personalities found in the operas of Atlanta-based composer Dr. Sharon Willis.",
